# Project: Minesweeper Game  
  
Team member: Jason You, Diana Hu  
  
This is a classic minesweeper game with 3 difficulty setting. Minesweeper is a puzzle game where you uncover squares on a grid while using numbered clues to avoid hidden mines.  
  
To run the game: run the MineSweeperGame.java file.

Limitation:  
1. Players cannot set the size of the map and the number of mines themselves, although there are difficulty selections providing 3 settings of map size and mine count.  
2. There is not a timer in the game.   
3. Unlike a traditional minesweeper game, players cannot place flags by right clicking. This is due to a limitation of the edu.macalester package. In order to place flag, players have to left click while holding the F key.  
  
Societal impacts:  
Minesweeper’s heavy reliance on visual cues (such as numbered tiles and mine icons) can make it inaccessible to players with visual impairments or color-blindness. Requiring a mouse for precise clicking may limit access for users who rely on assistive devices.
